gitpaste
=========

GitPaste is an open-source git-backed pasting web-application modeled 
after http://gist.github.com with a few features removed and a few features
added. The goal of GitPaste is to provide a self-contained and deployable 
modern pasting utility for organizations, companies, and so on where using 
something like http://gist.github.com is just not feasible.
